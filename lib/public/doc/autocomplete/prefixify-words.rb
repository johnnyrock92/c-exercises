# What we do is the following: instead of adding only full words to
# the sorted set, we add also all the possible prefixes of any given
# word. We also need a way to distinguish actual words from
# prefixes. So this is what we do:

# 1. For every word, like "bar", we add all the prefixes: "b", "ba", "bar".
# 2. For every word we finally add the word itself but with a trailing "*" character,
